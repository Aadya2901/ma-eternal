# 🌸 Ma-Eternal – Care. Comfort. Confidence.
*A Compassionate Maternal Health & Wellness Web App*

**Ma-Eternal** is a responsive, privacy-first maternal health and wellness web application designed to support women across every stage of their reproductive journey — from menstruation and ovulation to pregnancy, mental well-being, and self-care.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** Ma-Eternal is **not a medical or diagnostic platform**.  
> It provides general wellness insights and self-care guidance and does **not replace professional medical advice**.
